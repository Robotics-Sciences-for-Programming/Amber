CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:22 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findamber_b1_description.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "amber_b1_description", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "amber_b1_description" with any of the following names:

    amber_b1_descriptionConfig.cmake
    amber_b1_description-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "amber_b1_description" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "amber_b1_description_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "amber_b1_description" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
